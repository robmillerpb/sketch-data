Take the interface further by using realistic data to populate the user interface
Working with Data#
Select the shape or text layer you want to add Data to, click on the Data button in the toolbar, or choose Layer > Data, and select the type of Data you want to insert.

How to Refresh and Clear Data#
Press ⌘ + ⇧ + D or choose Refresh Data from the Data menu to fill your layer with different images or text from your Data source.

To remove the connection between your Data source and a layer, click Disconnect from Data Source in the Data menu.

Note: Disconnecting from a Data source won’t restore your layer’s original contents.

How to Use Data with Symbols#
You can add multiple Data sources to different layers within a Symbol and refresh them all at the same time.

You can also add or refresh Data within a Symbol using the Data icon next to each Symbol override.

Adding New Data Sources#
You can create your own Data sources and add them to the Data tab in Preferences.

Tip: Make sure to save your Data sources in a place that won’t change. If you move the location of your Data sources after you’ve added them, Sketch will not be able to find them.

Creating a Text Data Source#
To create your own text Data source, create a plain text (.txt) file with each data value on a new line:

Afghanistan
Albania
Algeria
Andorra
Angola
...
Creating an Image Data Source#
For a new image Data source, all you need to do is create a folder with all the different images you want to use inside and add it via the Data tab in Preferences.
